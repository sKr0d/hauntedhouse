# Haunted House
This is the repo for my Haunted House.

I created the haunted house in 2020 as a no-contact way of handing out candy during the Covid pandemic. The plan was to create an interesting haunted house set that was inviting. Trick-or-treaters could press the doorbell on the house and candy would be dispensed.

In actuality, I had few visitors, and had difficulty getting the candy to slide down the tube properly.  So, a new candy delivery mechanism still needs to be developed.

This repository contains several directories for different devices involved in the overall project.

1. fan -- The microcontroller that controls the fan speed for the fog.
2. house -- The microcontroller that controls the lighting effects in the windows of the house.
3. marquee -- The microcontroller that controls the marquee lighting around the outside of the house.
4. pumpkin -- The microcontroller that handles the lighting inside the candy delivery pumpkin inside the house.
5. tank_monitor -- The microcontroller that ensures that the bubble tank is full.

** Sad to say that the haunted house was destroyed in the heavy wind/rain in California over the winter months.  It was too big to store in the garage, it got wet, and then the heavy wind finished it off.  :( **
